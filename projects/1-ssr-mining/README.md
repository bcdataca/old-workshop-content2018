# Predicting heavy equipment failure

**Hosted by:** SSR Mining  
**Mentors:** Lieszl van Dyk and Vien Dang  
**Student member:** Junbo Bao

## Goal

Proactively predict equipment failure prior to when the failure event occurs
using equipment production, maintenance and alerts information.

See the [project description](./ssr.pdf) for an in-depth summary of this
project.

## Data team notes

This project data set is very well curated. There are few missing values; the
data and formatting are well described; and the data scope is sufficiently
targeted to a particular task. Even still, this project has perhaps the largest
data set of the five projects. The data team believes that the project group
will have to make judicious use of Junbo Bao's domain knowledge, and be prepared
to deftly target feasible goals as a carefully coordinated group effort.
