# Determining intent and automating knowledge base creation from live chat transcripts

**Hosted by:** Comm100  
**Mentors:** David Carlson and Kevin Gao

## Goal

The goals for this challenge can be comprised as follows. 
1. Cluster or Correlate chat sessions:
    * Build an algorithm or methodology to cluster or correlate similar issues
      across chat sessions defined by you
2. We have a Knowledge Base (KB) tool but it is manual work on the client side
   to create Q&A’s. Is there a way to progress towards full automation in
   building a Knowledge Base with what’s already there?
    * Build a KB comprised of questions and their corresponding answers in an
      automated way.

In essence, the challenge for participants is to develop a mathematical model
for determining intent [of the client, based on their chat messages], and to
develop a tool that can be used to repeat that process with new data sets (i.e.,
the tool should be robust, generalizable, extensible).

## Data team notes

Users who are familiar with computational linguistics and its tools (*e.g.,*
[`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org/)), or who are comfortable analyzing large amounts
of text data will be well-suited for tackling this project. We anticipate that
familiarity with topic models and related machine learning tools would be a
bonus.
