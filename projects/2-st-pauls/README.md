# Connecting genetic mutations to cytokine levels

**Hosted by:** St. Paul's Hospital  
**Mentor:** Keith Wallace

## Goal

Find patterns of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs: genotype data) that
beget particular cytokine levels (phenotype data).

## Data team notes

This project is well suited to individuals with some level of background
knowledge in genetics or biochemistry. The mentor and the data team have
provided extensive material that should allow the unacquainted a detailed
jump-start. In particular, a research material detailing a similar analysis, and
a Jupyter notebook that outlines how to import and walk through the data set.
