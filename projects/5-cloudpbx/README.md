# Analyzing user opinion of call quality, and network performance of a VoIP PBX

**Hosted by:** CloudPBX  
**Mentor:** Graham Nelson-Zutter  
**Student member:** Matthew Fung

## Goal

Determine if machine learning techniques would be beneficial in providing
analysis to create adaptive and proactive connectivity and call routing rules by
analyzing the call history and call quality analysis dataset.

## Data team notes

This project offers somewhere between 500 MB and 250 GB of data for analyzing
network performance and predicting user opinion of call quality. The team
believes a project group could feasibly expect to make progress using a smaller
chunk of these data, with greater potential for success in designing scalable
methods. The data comprise some technical and domain-specific aspects of VoIP
and PBX technologies, for which the insight of Matthew Fung may invaluably
expedite the learning and prototyping process.
